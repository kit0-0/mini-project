      Fill in the blank <br />
      An old man <input type="text" id="input1" value="lived in" /> the village.
      He was one of the most
      <input type="text" id="input2" value="happy" /> people in the world. The
      whole village was <br />
      tired of him; he was always gloomy, he
      <input type="text" id="input3" value="want" /> complained and was always
      in a bad mood.<br />

      The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous
      were his words. People avoided<br />
      him, because
      <input type="text" id="input4" value="post" /> became contagious. It was
      even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.
